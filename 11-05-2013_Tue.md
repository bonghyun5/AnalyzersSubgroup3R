Tuesday Presentation

Part 1 Google Calendar

There have been some confusion of subgroup divisions due to time constraints in class.
We have come to a roadblock of time scheduling conflict. It is good that we seek help in office hour and is introduced more
in depth features of the google calendar. After office hour, we have decided to make a regular meeting schedule for this class.
By doing so, we hope that we can work more efficiently and coordinate better in the up coming group project assignments. 
Though we have experienced sort of failure this time, but we have confidence that we can improve in the next assignment.
Below is the schedule on google calendar that everyone agree upon.

We met some roadblocks while using google calendar. First, in order to set up meetings, everyone must be using BCal.
Those who were using Google Calendar copied that calendar to BCal using instructions found at http://kb.berkeley.edu/campus-shared-services/page.php?id=27006.
Now, we can compare all of our schedules back to back to find easy meeting times. Another roadblock we faced was 
when using the event invitations. It would not email everyone we wanted because we were not all listed as guests - the person who
created the event was not always listed and thus not always emailed.

Since we were not able to get a presenter during class due to time constraints, this part of the presentation will be coordinated
by our techincal lead Alyssa, as appointed by Aaron in office hour because she is familiar in using the Google Calendar.


Part 2 ETAS package in R

There have been some miscommunication between our subgroups within the analyzers for the work distribution. 
We have done preliminary exploraton on the ETAS package in R. If time is allowed, we will present our exploration findings. This part
is mainly responsible by our operation lead Bonghyun. All members in our group will be participating and present their findings if 
time is allowed.
